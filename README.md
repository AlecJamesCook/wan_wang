Web page built using Flask that converts Arabic numerals into Pinyin (Chinese romanization) and Chinese Characters (汉字).

Created since existing alternatives are incorrect, not very well designed, or are generally unavailable. The Chinese use a different number scale (the myriad scale) to Arabic Numberals. Conversion between the two systems can therefore be quite confusing.
